                        <li>One of the most important reasons why people like to drink butterfly pea flower tea so much, is to support their weight loss efforts.  </li>
                        <li>One promising in-vitro study from 2019, claims that butterfly pea flower extract can slow the formation of new fat cells (1). </li>
                        <li>Butterfly pea flower extract contains many compounds that could possibly support weight loss, including ternatins (2). Some studies even refer to ternatins as fat accumulation inhibitors (3).
                        </li> 
                        <h3>2. Promotes hair growth</h3>

                        </li>
                        <li>Until recently, there was basically no scientific research to back up the claims that blue pea extract can promote hair growth.</li>
                        <li>Recently we got some scientific confirmation that butterfly pea flower extract can be effectively used against hair loss. 
                        </li><h3>3. High in antioxidants</h3>
                        <li>Butterfly pea contains many antioxidants, including anthocyanins (6). These compounds are commonly found in many "health foods", including blueberries, pomegranates and other berries, red cabbage etc (7). 

                        <ul> Research suggests that anthocyanins could have many potential health benefits, including (8):</ul>

                        <h3>1. Used as Air freshener: </h3>
                        <li>The majority of eucalyptus oils are used in spray mists, electric room diffusers, and scent lamps. To create a straightforward mist spray, 50 to 100 drops of essential oil, or around, should be diluted in 4 fluid ounces (120ml) of purified water. Spray to rehydrate and purify the air.
                        </li><h3>2. Effective anti-allergic: </h3>
                        <li>Bronchitis is characterised by a persistent, difficult-to-breathe cough.</li>
                            <li>      Congestion makes breathing difficult and being sick more miserable.</li>
                                <li>     The lingering cold may be sinusitis. Sinus infection symptoms include congestion and headache.</li>
                                    <li>      Eucalyptus eases asthma breathing.</li>
                                    <h3>3. Use as Antiseptic:</h3>
                                    <ul>The medicinal Eucalyptus oil is perhaps the most potent antiseptic of its class, especially when it is old because ozone is created when it is exposed to air. It is the chosen one due to its disinfecting activity, killing lower forms of life.
                                    </ul>
                                   <h3> 4. Soothes your throat:</h3>
<ul>Gargles with eucalyptus oil are stimulating and antiseptic. When applied locally, it inhibits sensibility. It enhances heart function.</ul> 

<h3>5. Acts as insect repellent:</h3>
<ul>Its antiseptic properties confer some antimalarial efficacy; nonetheless, it cannot replace Cinchona’s effectiveness.</ul>

<h3>6. Keeps worms away:</h3> 
<ul>For a while, Eucalyptus-chloroform was used as a treatment for hookworm in the tropics. This is because it contains phytochemicals like borneol, cineol, linalool, geranyl acetate, saffrol, and antheol, which kill different types of intestinal worms.</ul>

<h3>7. Reduces joint pain :</h3> 
<ul>Eucalyptus oil has been used to reduce pain and stop inflammation in different animal models. We looked at how inhaling eucalyptus oil affected pain, blood pressure, heart rate, CRP concentration, and WBC count in patients with osteoarthritis who had a total knee replacement.</ul>

<h3>8. Acts as Antiviral:</h3> 
<ul>In vitro and in vivo investigations reveal that Eucalyptus essential oil’s antiviral and virucidal impact is based on its components’ direct action on free virions, inhibiting the virus from spreading in the host cells.</ul>

<h3>9. Cures fungal growth:</h3> 
<ul>When humans with facial demodicosis were treated with freshly made camphor oil (Eucalyptus globulus) with or without glycerol dilutions, they were completely cured at 100%, 75%, and 50% concentrations.</ul>

<h3>10. Keeps good oral health:</h3>
<ul>The use of Eucalyptus globulus could be beneficial in preventing the growth of dental plaque.</ul>

<h3>11. Used for aromatherapy:</h3> 
<ul>Terpineol is a relatively non-toxic, volatile monoterpenoid alcohol. It is a significant component of the essential oil of Eucalyptus globulus (Eucalyptus), which is widely used in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Terpineol is found in high concentrations in both of these types of oils.</ul>

<h2 style="color:rgb(198, 30, 216)">BENIFETS OF Mint / Pudina</h2> 
<h3>Health Benefits Of Mint Leaves</h3>
   <li> Mint is a good source of vitamins and antioxidants. It also contains fair amounts of phosphorus, calcium, iron, fibre, and manganese. However, the nutrient composition varies among different varieties. Below are some of the popularly known health benefits of mint leaves or pudina.</li>
<h3>Treat digestive issues</h3>
    <li>  Mint leaves has been used for centuries as a remedy for digestive problems, such as gas, bloating and indigestion. Studies suggest that peppermint oil can help relax the digestive system and relieve spasms in your gut. According to a study, peppermint oil capsules helped reduce irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by 40 per cent after four weeks,
     compared to only 24.3 per cent with placebo. Clinical trials in children also found that taking peppermint oil reduced the frequency, length and severity of abdominal pain. Mint is also found effective in treating nausea and easing morning sickness.</li>
<h3>Improve blood pressure</h3>
    <li>  High blood pressure or hypertension is a common preventable risk factor for heart disease. Animal studies indicate that peppermint tea could lower blood pressure. In one study, oral administration of menthol, the main component of peppermint, reduced 24-hour mean arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive rats.</li>
    Provide relief from colds and allergies
    Menthol, the active ingredient in peppermint, is known as an effective decongestant. This is the reason menthol is widely used in cough syrups to help soothe sore throats and suppress coughing. It may also help get relief from stuffy noses caused by colds or allergies. Research suggests that inhaling menthol appears to make breathing easier, presumably due to the cooling sensation it creates upon inhalation.

<h3>Boost immunity</h3>
<li>Mint is packed with vitamins and antioxidants to improve your immunity. Studies have shown that peppermint oil can effectively kill bacteria, including common food-borne bacteria E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella, Staphylococcus and pneumonia-linked bacteria.
</li>
<h3>Reduce chronic pain</h3>
<li>Peppermint oil has been traditionally used to relieve pain associated with arthritis for years. However, there is not enough evidence to support the pain-relieving effects of peppermint. Mint oil is used in traditional Chinese remedies for the treatment of sprains, joint pains and inflammation. In a study, peppermint inhalation aromatherapy reduced the pain and anxiety caused by intravenous catheterization in cardiac patients.
</li>
<h3>Help in breastfeeding pain</h3>
<li>Help in breastfeeding painSore and cracked nipples can make breastfeeding painful and difficult. It is one common cause of premature breastfeeding cessation. Research has shown that applying mint essential oil helps relieve pain and heal soreness and cracked nipples. Peppermint water use was associated with less nipple pain compared to the application of expressed breast milk.
</li>
<h3>Improve skin health</h3>
<li>The powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties of mint make it effective for the treatment of skin related problems like acne, and scars. The herb contains salicylic acid and vitamin A, which help control the secretion of sebum oil in the skin and treat or prevent acne. In addition, the presence of menthol and natural antioxidants make mint leaves an amazing cleanser, toner, astringent and moisturizer for the skin.
     This is the reason why mint is used as an active ingredient in many skin care products.</li>

<h2>BENIFETS OF Lavender </h2>
<ul>Lavender is an herb native to northern Africa and the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. Medicinal uses may include helping with mood, anxiety, and depression.</ul>

   <ul> Lavender is also grown for the production of its essential oil, which comes from the distillation of the flower spikes of certain lavender species.</ul>
    
    <ul>The oil has cosmetic uses, and many people believe it has medicinal uses.</ul>
    
   <ul> Lavender essential oil, in contrast to the plant form, is toxic when swallowed.</ul>
    
    <ul>Although research suggests essential oils may have some health benefits, it is important to remember that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not monitor or regulate the purity or quality of these oils. A person should talk with a healthcare professional before using essential oils and research the quality of a particular brand’s products. It is also important to always do a patch test before trying a new essential oil.</li>
<li></li>
<h2>The forms of lavender</h2>
   <ul> You can use lavender in these forms:</ul>
   <li>Essential oil.</li>
    <li>Extract.</li>
    <li>Plant (flower, stem and leaves).</li>
   <li> Tea.</li>
   <h2>How to use lavender essential oil</h2>
   <ul>The sky’s the limit when it comes to uses for lavender essential oil. Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts. Because they are so strong, use them sparingly and with care.</ul>
  <ul>Dr. Lin suggests trying a few drops of lavender essential oil in:</ul>
  <li>Baths.</li>
    <li>Distilled water to make a room or body spray.</li>
    <li>Massage oil.</li>
    <ul>If you plan on using lavender essential oil on your skin, Dr. Lin notes the importance of diluting it with another oil. Good oils to use are ones you aren’t allergic to and might include:</ul>
   <li>Almond oil.</li>
   <li>Coconut oil.</li>
    <li>Jojoba oil</li>
    <li> Olive oil.</li> 
    <h2>Cleaning with lavender essential oil</h2>
    <ul>“To make a homemade cleaning solution, add a few drops of lavender essential oil to distilled water, some vinegar and a few drops of castile soap. The vinegar and soap help cut grease, and the soap and lavender have antimicrobial properties,” explains Dr. Lin. “You also get that beautiful scent.”</ul>
