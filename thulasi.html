<h2>What Is Tulsi? Characteristics of the Tulsi Plant</h2>
<ul>The tulsi plant is a small, leafy, vibrant green shrub that is either a perennial or an annual, depending on where it's grown. A member of the basil family (Lamiaceae), its leaves can be green or purple, depending on the variety. It has a halo of fragrant, aromatic blossoms—a favorite among bees and pollinators of all kinds.1,2</ul>
<ul>Considered one of the most revered and celebrated Ayurvedic herbs, tulsi grows abundantly throughout Southeast Asia—especially in India.3 Our partners at Banyan Farm in Southern Oregon have also had success growing an abundance of tulsi. The growing season in Southern Oregon provides plenty of sunlight and heat, two requirements that help tulsi thrive.</ul>

<h2>What Is Tulsi Used For?</h2>
<ul>Tulsi has many benefits for the body, mind, and spirit, offering support on both physical and subtle levels. Some of the benefits of tulsi include:</ul>
<li>Offering Adaptogenic Support. Considered one of the foremost adaptogenic herbs, tulsi helps the body cope with stress, promotes mental clarity, and supports rejuvenation . </li>
<li>Supporting Lung Health. Tulsi is renowned for its support of the lungs, removing kapha buildup, and promoting healthy, uncongested breathing.</li>
<li>Promoting Healthy Circulation. It promotes healthy circulation thanks to its work in the plasma tissue layer ( rasa dhatu ), and, by extension, tulsi encourages a strong and healthy heart. </li>
<li>Supporting Weight Management. Tulsi helps promote healthy weight management thanks to its effect in the adipose tissue layer ( meda dhatu ).</li>
<li>Maintaining a Normal Body Temperature. Mysteriously, although considered heating, tulsi helps maintain a normal body temperature. In Ayurveda , this is called its prabhava , a quality that cannot be understood by looking at its energetics alone.</li>
<li>Balancing Vata and Kapha Doshas.In addition to its ability to balance kapha in the lungs, it also balances excess kapha and  vata  in the head and nerves, and is often used to soothe vata in the digestive tract.</li>
