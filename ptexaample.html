                        <li>2.Aloe vera is known for its thick, pointed, and fleshy green leaves, which may grow to about

                             a large family of substances known as polyphenols.</li>
                        <li>2.These polyphenols, along with several other compounds in aloe vera, help inhibit the growthTrusted Source 
                            of certain bacteria that can cause infections in humans.</li>  
                        <li>3.Aloe vera is known forTrusted Source its antibacterial, antiviral, and antiseptic properties.

                        <li>1.People most often use aloe vera as a topical medicationTrusted Source, rubbing it onto the skin rather than consuming it. 
                            In fact, it has a long history of use in treating sores, and particularly burns, including sunburn.</li> 
                        <li>2.The United States Pharmacopeia described aloe vera preparations as a skin protectant as early as 1810–1820.</li>   
                        <li>3.Studies suggest that it is an effective topical treatment for first and second-degree burns.</li>

                            dermatitis – a skin condition that causes a reddish rash with crusty, yellow-white scales, usually on the face and scalp.</li> 
                        <li>2.One older study indicated that aloe vera significantly reduces itchiness,

                        <li>3.Given that seborrheic dermatitis can lead to temporary hair loss,
                             this underscores aloe vera’s potential for promoting hair growth.</li>

                        <li>5.Indeed, the NCCIHTrusted Source report that nondecolorized whole leaf 
                             extract of aloe vera seems to be associated with cancer risk in rats.</li>
